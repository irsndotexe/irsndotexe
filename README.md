Greetings !

My name is Inácio Ribeiro, I was born in 1998 and I live in São Paulo - Brazil

I'm a rookie in programming, looking for a opportunity  to work in a company where I can develop, help and improve my skills. 

Nowadays I am graduating in Computer Science, the first programming language I have been in touch was Java that explains why it is the one I personally like the most.

I have started working since I was 11 years old, where I was paid to help produce educational material for schools, such as alphabets in many different styles, letters where children can form their names and so on. 

Years later I started working at a cyber café near my house, in this work I had to manage time in computers, print files, copy documents... 

Currently I work in a Multinational company as a Support Analyst, helping customers with product difficult, settings, bugs and purchase.
