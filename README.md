# Hi, I'm In√°cio Ribeiro
#### Rookie developer, workaholic and fascinated with tech, games and tv series. 

Currently I work in a Multinational company as a Support Analyst, helping customers with product difficult, settings, bugs and purchase.
Nowadays I am graduating in Computer Science, the first programming language I have been in touch was Java that explains why it is the one I personally like the most. I I'm looking for a opportunity  to work in a company where I can develop, help and improve my skills.
